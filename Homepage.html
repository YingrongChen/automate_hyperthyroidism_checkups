    <h2>Intro: digital medicine in thyroidology</h2>
    <p>Digitized medical information, such as height, weight, blood pressure, pulse rate, and blood test results,
        has emerged as a highly promising field and changed the landscape of disease prediction, prevention, diagnosis, 
        treatment, and post-treatment management.
    </p>
    <p>Hyperthyroidism is a chronic condition when patients’ overactive thyroids produce too much thyroxine 
        hormones. After being diagnosed, patients will take anti-thyroid drugs and recheck their thyroid 
        hormone levels regularly to determine an appropriate amount of medication. Besides, hyperthyroidism 
        often relapses after the initial treatment. I believe digital science will make monitoring hyperthyroidism
         easier. The Thyroid Function Test (TFT) usually give patients data of certain hormone levels along with 
         suggested ranges recognized as normal/too much/too little. Besides, hyperthyroidism is closely related to
          easily collectable medical data like heart rate and weight. I want to develop a program that can take in
           the blood test results as well as the patients’ heart rate and weight, and then check the progress or 
           regress of hyperthyroidism. This is particularly useful to avoid overdose during treatment period and 
           check for disease recurrence in the remission period after treatment. With helps from professional 
           endocrinologists, this program may give suggestion in whether to change the prescriptions (although 
           in the early-stage patients should still follow their doctors’ guidelines). Similar programs can be built 
           for other hormone diseases or chronic conditions that have relatively simple checkups after diagnosis or 
           initial treatment.</p>
